CRY§TAL§ (old)
=============
DEVELOPMENT HAS MOVED
---------------------

Development has split from this project into two others:

    * `tinyrpg <http://github.com/dustinrohde/tinyrpg/>`_, an API that
      makes it easy to write RPG/adventure games, and
    * `crystals <http://github.com/dustinrohde/crystals/>`_, the game
      itself, implemented using the *tinyrpg* API.

This decision was influenced by the need to separate policy from
implementation. I abandoned this repository to facilitate the split,
so each of the child repos has its own brand new version history.
All of the tests are being rewritten as well, making use of mocks this
time.
