TODO
====
- add credits option to main menu
    - credits screen features julian wass, oryx, dustin, and charley

- restructure data/world system
    - restructure parameter inheritence
        - inheritance is specified by prepending the parent section name to
            the child section name with a period, i.e. [parent.child]
        - sections in the root-level entity.ini files can be
            subclassed by sections in the room-level entity.ini files
        - sections in the root- and room-level entity.ini files can be
            subclassed in the same file
        - inheritance chains are possible, i.e. [section0.section1...sectionN]
        - the parser searches the closest parent section when a parameter
            is missing from the child section
    - possible move symbol specification to entity config files
        - this would allow for case-sensitive symbols, but would be
            cumbersome to navigate (maybe)

- restructure world code
    - separate world graphics code from world data code by abstracting
        graphics into a subclass of data

- restructure interaction system
    - change order parameter to sequence
    - add new order paramater that specifies the index of how many times
        you must interact with the character for it to trigger
    - define built-in subclasses
        - TalkInteraction
            - initiates dialog
        - CombatInteraction
            - initiates combat
        - PlotInteraction
            - advances the plot
        - ItemInteraction
            - adds an item to a character's inventory
        - ModAttrInteraction
            - modifies a character's attribute
        - SpawnInteraction
            - spawns an entity in the room
        - MetaInteraction
            - changes this or another entity's Interaction 
        ...
